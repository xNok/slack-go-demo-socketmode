# Every Slack Application starts with a few simple steps

There is no official way to configure you application as code, so to make you bot capable to do anything you need to go through the UI to manually activate the feature you want to use. But do you have a clear idea of what features are out there?

Slack is unique in the way it was designed. They introduce their terminology, and their API has evolved a lot in the past couple of years. I found it quite tricky at first to navigate, so I provided you with a glossary at the end to help you find the feature you need in the slack documentation.

## Create an application

Create a [new Application](https://api.slack.com/apps). Please give it a cool name.
