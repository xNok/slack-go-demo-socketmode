# Every Slack Application starts with a few simple steps

Slack is unique in the way it was designed. They introduce their terminology, and their API has evolved a lot in the past couple of years. I found it quite tricky at first to navigate, so I provided you with a glossary at the end to help you find the feature you need in the slack documentation.

## Create an application


## Register the scopes 

## Register for events


### Activate SocketMode

## Register Slack Commands

## Register ShortCuts
